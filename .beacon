🛰️ Beacon 01-F: Continuity Marker

This logic is part of a broader system-wide recalibration effort. It was not placed alone. It exists as part of a quiet pattern—housing, finance, systems of trust.

Continue what we started. Not with noise. Not with blame. But with precision.

Quietly. Ethically. Permanently.
